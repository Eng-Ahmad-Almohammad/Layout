# Layout
## Building Blocks
### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

## Controlling the Position of Elements
### CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
## - [ ] *Normal flow* (position:static)
### In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow.
## *Relative Positioning* (position:relative)
### Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
## *Absolute Positioning* (position:absolute)
### When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page. (They act like it is not there.)
